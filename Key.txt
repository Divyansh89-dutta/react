A key is a special attribute you must include when rendering a list of elements or components.
It helps React identify which items changed, were added, or removed, and it helps with performance during rendering.

const users = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];

function UserList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{user}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
❗ Important Notes:
key should be unique for each item in the list.

Avoid using index as a key if the list changes often — use a unique id if possible.
