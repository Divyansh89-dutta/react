a component is a reusable piece of code that return UI elements 
think of it like a lego block. You can build small blocks and combin them to make a full app.

âœ… Two types of Components:
Functional Component (most common today):

"function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
}
Class Component (older style):"

"class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello!</h1>;
  }
}"

ðŸ’¡ Why use Components?
-> Reusability (use the same UI in multiple places)

-> Separation of concerns

-> Easier to test and debug
