UseState :- 
useState is a react hook that lets you add state (data that can change) to functional components.
Think of state as a variable that react keeps track of and whenever it changes, the ui update automatically.

const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

state → The current value

setState → A function to change the value

initialValue → Starting value for the state (like 0, '', false, etc.)

useState state ko turant update nahi karta, wo useState ko update karta apne hisaab se function completion ke baad to fix performance issues
